## Dependencies:
- [SIAMFANLEquations.jl](https://github.com/ctkelley/SIAMFANLEquations.jl)
  - You need v 0.3.0 or higher. As of today, you have to get it from the pkg REPL with 
  
  ```add https://github.com/ctkelley/SIAMFANLEquations.jl#master```
  
     because I have not pushed 0.3.0 yet.

- FastGaussQuadrature

## Problems
If you're Ryan or one of this students, you know how to find me. Otherwise ... go away.
